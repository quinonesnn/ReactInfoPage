Learning the basics of React

What I've Learned:
    There is a easy and hard way to set up React

    Easy Way: 
        Pass in these script tags into the header:
            <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
            <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
        Then add a type to the javascript file that is being used:
            type="text/babel"
        Doing this gives access to a global variable called ReactDOM
        The first basic function is ReactDOM.render(HTMLcode, document.getElementById(id))
